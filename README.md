# Votando, Naturalmente

### **Description**: I obtained data of the manifestos of the largest parties running in SpainÂ´s 2019 general election. After extracting such data, I use the Spacy library to clean, delete stopwords, lemmatize and tokenize the grouped text. I then run a vector function to identify cosine similarities with input data obtained through voice recognition API. The output is a visualization with similarity percentages of input with each parties manifesto.
